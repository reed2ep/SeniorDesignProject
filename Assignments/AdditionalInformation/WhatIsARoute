# What is a Bouldering Route? 🧗‍♀️

In **indoor bouldering**, a **route**—commonly called a **boulder problem**—is a predefined climbing sequence set on a **bouldering wall** by the gym's routesetters. These routes challenge a climber’s **strength, technique, and problem-solving skills**.

## 🏢 Key Features of a Bouldering Route

- **Color-Coded Holds** – Each problem is marked with **colored tape** or has **holds of the same color** to indicate the path to follow. In our app, we suppose the later, so inputted pictures should make sure routes have the same color holds!
- **Starting Hold** – Routes should have a tag, or some other sort of marker depending on the gym, to tell the climber where their hands should be placed to start.
  - **Single-Start** - The most common type of start is a single start, where both hands are placed on the same starting hold.
  - **2-Hand-Start** - It is also possible a route has 2 starting holds marked. This doesnt mean you can use either! Place one hand on each of the starting holds to begin the route.
  - **Foot-Start???** - In most cases, starting places for feet are not marked. You may use any holds that match the color of the route for feet. If you desire, you may also put your feet on the wall itself instead of holds! This is known as **Smearing**.

- **No Ropes or Harnesses** – Climbers rely on **padded floors (crash pads)** for safety.
- **Graded for Difficulty** – Bouldering problems have difficulty ratings. The Bigger the number, the harder the route! Some common grading formats are:
  - **V-Grade (V0 to V17)**
  - **Fontainebleau System (3 to 9A)**

## 🎨 How Boulder Problems Are Set

- **Route Setters** design problems to challenge climbers with **specific movements**.
- Holds are placed to require **balance, dynamic moves, strength, etc.**.
- Some problems focus on:
  - **Power Moves** – Big, explosive jumps (**dynos**).
  - **Technical Sequences** – Precise footwork and delicate body positioning.
  - **Slopers & Crimps** – Grip strength challenges.

Each bouldering route is like a puzzle, requiring **both physical effort and mental strategy** to complete!
