   Abstract:Indoor climbing is a growing sport that challenges both physical and mental skills, yet navigating optimal routes on boulder problems can be daunting for climbers, particularly at beginner and           intermediate levels. This project introduces an Android-based application designed to assist climbers by identifying and visualizing optimal climbing paths on indoor boulder walls. Using advanced image              processing techniques such as blob detection and path-finding algorithms, the app scans bouldering routes, detects holds of a specified color, and evaluates them based on factors like size, wall angle, 
and climber-specific metrics such as height and limb reach. The app generates a suggested sequence of moves, visually represented by a stick figure model, prioritizing efficient movement and energy 
conservation. Targeting climbers at V3 and below, the application aims to make climbing more accessible, improve technique, and provide a personalized and interactive climbing experience. By leveraging 
computational power and machine learning technologies, the app bridges the gap between traditional climbing practice and modern innovation.
