Reasearch on path finidng optimization:

Waypoints are the key decision points where you might have to change direction. In the above diagram, I mark places where you have to go around a corner or wall. I call these “exterior corners”.
Navigation meshes are the walkable regions of the map. Regions can be any size and shape. These store the key decision points and also a way to pathfind from/to any other points that aren’t the waypoints.
Hierarchical approaches have coarse and fine level map representations. An approximate path is found with the coarse level, and then refined with the fine level.
Quad trees use square regions of various sizes to represent the map. Large open areas can be represented by a few squares. Irregular edges can be represented by many small squares. See this; please send me references.

Optimized BLOB pathfinding:

A* is a popular choice for pathfinding because it's flexible and can be used in many contexts. It's considered the industry standard for finding the shortest path between two nodes.

Use a priority queue with bins, a partitioned priority queue, or batch process nodes in the priority queue. 

This can help smooth out artifacts in the map analysis that can occur on grid maps.
