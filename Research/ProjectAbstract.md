Indoor bouldering is a growing sport that can be both physically and mentally challenging. Finding efficient routes on boulder problems can be especially difficult for climbers, particularly for beginners. This project introduces an Android-based application designed to assist climbers by identifying and visualizing optimal climbing paths on indoor boulder walls. Combining blob detection and path-finding algorithms, the app scans bouldering routes, detects holds of a specified color, and evaluates them based on factors like size, wall angle, and climber-specific metrics such as height and limb reach. The app generates a suggested sequence of moves, visually represented by a stick figure model, prioritizing efficient movement and energy conservation. Targeting climbers at the V3 level and below, the application aims to make climbing more accessible, improve technique, and provide a personalized and interactive climbing experience. Our app bridges the gap between traditional climbing practice and modern technology.
